Python Projects Repository
Welcome to my Python repository! This space showcases some of my projects that highlight my skills in data extraction and analysis using Python.

Projects
1. Web Scraping: Top USA Companies by Revenue
In this project, I scraped data from Wikipedia on the top USA companies by revenue and revenue growth. I used Python libraries like pandas, BeautifulSoup, and requests to extract, clean, and store the data. This project demonstrates my ability to work with web data sources and manage data using Python.
